    "\n",
    "I find GeoPackages to be by far the easiest way to distribute geo-data now: they are a single file (in a database-like format that supports multiple types of data), include the projection information by default, and QGIS can even embed information about rendering style! \n",

    "However, we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves; let's start by writing a function (it will be _similar_ to the `get_url` function in `dtools`) to download the file to our hard drive and save it there. That way we don't have to keep downloading it week after week. I've set up the basics, but you'll need to Google [download remote file python](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+download+a+remote+file&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB917GB917&oq=python+download+a+remote+file). If you're not sure about what something in this function does, I'd suggest that you use `return` statements to short-circuit the processing and `print` statements to output the various variables that I derive (e.g. `print(os.path.split(url.path))` and then add `[-1]` to see what that gives you or `print(url)` to see what that is!)."

Do <i>not</i> think of Python's output as being 'maps' in the GIS sense, they are composed of 'patches' of color on abstract 'axes' that can use any arbitrary coordinate space. So colours are 'really' triplet (or quadruplet if you have alpha-blending transparency) values in the range 0.0-1.0. Annotations are then added in similarly abstract fashion.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've got our layers looking roughly how we want them, it's time to combine them. This is also reliant on `matplotlib` and basically involves plotting items to _shared axes_ which is done by passing in `ax=<axis object>` to each `plot(...)`. By convention, if you only have a single figure (e.g. a single map) then you create an axis object and name it `ax` so you will see a lot of `ax=ax` code in graphing libraries, but `=ax` is just saying 'assign to the axis object that I created'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the axes are how you control what is shown, see if you can find out by Googling how to set the x- and y-limits on the map so that it shows only London and trims out the much larger area of water that is outside of the Greater London Authority. **As a rough guideline, this has the Easting range 501,000 to 563,000, and the Northing range 155,000 to 202,000.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set these limits before or after you start adding layers to the 'map', but it's probably easier conceptually to add them after with the idea of 'zooming in' on the features of interest. It's also easier to debug since you can start by seeing if you can plot the elements at all, and _then_ add the limits to zoom.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So the steps are:**\n",
    "1. Write the code to plot every image on the same set of axes (I've given you something to get started).\n",
    "2. Google how to set the limits of the map and then use the ranges I've offered above.\n",
