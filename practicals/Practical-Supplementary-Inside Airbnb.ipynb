    "However, the rapid visualisation of the _full_ Airbnb data set using Geopandas/PySAL is hard: there's simply so much of it that visualisation is slow unless you're in a dedicated environment with lots of RAM. So, for the _exploratory_ part of our work we'd normally want to work with a _sample_ -- but what happens if every time we take a sample we get a _different_ sample? That obviously makes things a bit harder, it would be handy if we could get the _same_ random sample every time _while_ we're doing our testing and development before expanding to the full data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where `random.seed` and comes in: by setting a seed we ensure that any process based on a random/random sampling process will be reproducible. In other words, we'll get the _same_ random sample each time. To understand why this happens you'd need to read up on pseudo-randomness and computers but that's not really relevant here. Note, however, that we set the random seed in two places: in Python in general (`random`) and in numpy (`np.random`) because the latter is what Pandas usually uses."
