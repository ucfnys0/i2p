# About this Repository

The *Introduction to Programming* (I2P) module is part of CASA's [MSc degree offering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/programmes) builds on a step-change in our ability to work with large spatial data sets. The design of the module is informed by the dearth of planners and geographers able to *think* computationally using programming, data analysis, and data manipulation skills. There is a severe skills shortage in this domain across all sectors: non-profit, government, corporate, and academic.

The module's objective is to enable students to access, understand, utilise, visualise and communicate data in a spatial context. I2P is *not* about pushing buttons, but about using logic, programming, and analytical skills to tackle complex real-world problems in a creative, reproducible, and open manner.
