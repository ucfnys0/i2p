## What's a Class?

> A tight **coupling** or association of data structures with the methods or functions that act on the data. 

It is the **template** for producing new objects...

---
## What's an Object?

Objects are **instantiated** versions of classes: `"hello world"` is an **instance** of a string, and `['A','B',1,3]` is an **instance** of a list. 

Or: the class is your recipe, the object is your pizza...

### Really... Like a Pizza!

```
class pizza(object):
  base = 'sourdough'
  
  def __init__(self, sauce='tomato', cheese='mozzarella'):
    self.toppings = []
    self.sauce = sauce
    self.cheese = cheese
    
  def add_topping(self, topping: str) -> None:
    self.toppings.insert(len(self.toppings), topping)
  
  def get_pizza(self) -> list:
    ingredients = [self.base, self.sauce, self.cheese]
    ingredients.extend(self.toppings)
    return ingredients
```
---
### Pizza in Action

```
p = pizza(sauce='white')
p.add_topping('peppers')
p.add_topping('chilis')
p.get_pizza()
> ['sourdough', 'white', 'mozzarella', 'peppers', 'chilis']
```

### How to Roll a Pizza

A class is defined by:
```
class <name>(<parent class):
  ...
```
A class is initialised by:
```
  def __init__(self, <any parameters>):
    ...
```
All methods *have* to have this:
```
  def <method>(self, <any parameters>):
    ...
```

### How to Roll a Pizza (cont'd)

This variable is fairly simply:
```
  self.base = 'sourdough'
```

This variable is complicated:
```
  base = 'sourdough'
```

---
## Remember Your *Self*

> So the keyword `self` refers to the *instantiated* object: the object always passes a reference to itself as the **first parameter** in any method. And `self` in a variable definition (`self.topping`) is an **instance** variable, while `topping` is a class variable.

---
### Check it Out
```
p1 = pizza(sauce='white')
p1.add_topping('peppers')
p1.add_topping('chilis')

p2 = pizza()
p2.base = "Plain old base"
p2.add_topping('pineapple')
p2.add_topping('ham')

p1.get_pizza()
> ['sourdough', 'white', 'mozzarella', 'peppers', 'chilis']
p2.get_pizza()
> ['Plain old base', 'tomato', 'mozzarella', 'pineapple', 'ham']
```

--- 
### But...

```
pizza.base='Crusty' # <- Like changing a package var!
p1.get_pizza()  # <- Base has changed
> ['Crusty', 'white', 'mozzarella', 'peppers', 'chilis']
p2.get_pizza()  # <- Base has not changed!
> ['Plain old base', 'tomato', 'mozzarella', 'pineapple', 'ham']

p3 = pizza()
p3.get_pizza()  # <- Base has changed
> ['Crusty', 'tomato', 'mozzarella']
```

## Principles of Objects-Oriented Design

Three key terms:
1. Encapsulation: the bundling of the data and the methods that work on that data in **one unit**; data is *often* accessed via **methods** and not directly. I don't need to care **how** something works, only **that** it works.
2. Inheritance: classes can **inherit** functionality from 'parents' and then **extend** this in useful ways. So `geopandas` extends `pandas`, and `movingpandas` extends `geopandas`!
3. Polymorphism: a 'child' class can ideally be use anywhere its parent class can be used because it only **extends** (*i.e.* adds) functionality and does *not* break parent behaviour.

	Not Bacteria
		Archaea

## Tree of Vehicles

Most people would call this a class hierarchy or diagram.

{{org-chart}}
Vehicle
	2-Wheeler
		Bicycle
		Motorcycle
	Car
		Sedan
		Coupé
		Estate
	Truck
		Bus
		Van
		Tractor

  There is **no natural order here**: where do unicycles or rickshaws go?

## Classes vs Packages

> Functionally, a class and a package are indistinguishable, but a _class_ produces objects that use functions and constants, whereas a _package_ is a group of functions and constants that may, or may not, include classes.

Ugh, now try to keep _this_ straight in your head.

## Key Takeaways

1. You’ve been using Classes and Methods since you started. 
2. You can ‘package up’ useful code into functions, and useful functions into packages.
3. Together, packages and classes will turbo-charge your programming skills.
5. You can stand on the shoulders of giants!
