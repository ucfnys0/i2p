# Getting to Grips with Git

^ You will need two things to get started:

^ 1. `git` installed on *your* computer: [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
^ 2. A GitHub account: [github.com](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)

## Why You Need It

![Versions](img/phd101212s.gif) 

^ Version control has been around longer than the Internet. Broadly, it was designed to achieve three things:
^ 1. A record of and and all edits made to a file containing code.
^ 2. A means of allowing developers to share edits with one another.
^ 3. A way of reconciling conflicts when two (or more) developers edited the same code.
---
### However

Although we naturally connect version control to coding, you can use it **anywhere** that you have files that are changing (*hint:* essays, notes, projects, assessments, code...) and need/want to track them. 

**Bonus:** you *also* gain free backups if some part of your version control system is on a different computer!

---
## How It Works

The **natural way** to think about managing versions of a document is to have a *master* copy **somewhere**. Everyone asks the server for the master copy, makes some changes, and then checks those changes back in.

This is not how Git works.
---
## How Git Works

Git is **distributed**. You could call it peer-to-peer, meaning that *every* computer where git is installed is **its own server** and has its own *master copy*. 

So every computer has a **full history** of a file or project that been added to Git.

In order to make this **useful**, you need ways to synchronise changes between computers that all think *they're* right.

## GitHub

GitHub is **nothing special** to Git, just another server with which to negotiate changes. Do *not* think of GitHub as the 'master' copy. There isn't one.

## Using Git
---
### Getting Started

| Term | Means |
| :--- | :---- |
| Repository (Repo) | A project or achive stored in Git. |
| init | To create a new repo. |
| clone | To make a full copy of a repo somewhere else. |

For example:
```bash
mkdir i2p
cd i2p
git init
```
Or: `git clone https://github.com/jreades/i2p.git`

---
### Working on a File

| Term | Means |
| :--- | :---- |
| add  | Add a file to a repo. |
| Move (mv) | Move/Rename a file in a repo. |
| Remove (rm) | Remove a file from a repo. |

For example:
```bash
git add README.md
git mv README.md fileA.md
git rm fileA.md
```
But no one *else* knows about these changes yet!

---
### Looking at the History

| Term | Means |
| :--- | :---- |
| diff | Show changes between commits. |
| status | Show status of files in repo. |
| log | Show history of commits. |

For example:
```bash
git status
```

---
### Working on a Project or File
| Term | Means |
| :--- | :---- |
| commit | To record changes to the repo. |
| branch | Create or delete branches. |
| checkout | Jump to a different branch. |

For example:
```bash
git commit -m "Moved and then deleted README file."
```
---
### Collaborating on a Project

| Term | Means |
| :--- | :---- |
| pull | To request changes to a repo *from* another computer. |
| push | To send your changes to a repo *to* another computer. |

For example:
```
git push
```

---
## Consequences

All changes are **local** until you `push` them. 

If you forget to `push` your changes (e.g. to GitHub) then you are **not backed up** if your computer dies.

## This is *not* easy

### A Dropbox Analogy

- Think of the programming environment (Vagrant+JupyterLab) as being an application (like Word or Excel) that allows you to read/write/edit notebook files.
- Think of GitHub as being like Dropbox somewhere in the cloud that files on your home machine can be backed up.
- So you should not need to do anything in JupyterLab to move files to, or see changes on, GitHub.
- Git gives you much finer-grained control over files and syncrhonisation than Dropbox.

^ Like Dropbox, GitHub offers a lot of 'value added' featuers (like simple text editing) on top of the basic service of 'storing files'.

^ Dropbox will automatically back up anything that you put in your special Dropbox folder. 

^ Git will only back up the things that you tell it to back up, *even if* they are in the Git folder!

### A Note on Workflow

So your workflow should be:

1. Save edits to Jupyter notebook.
2. Run `git add <filename.ipynb>` to record changes to the notebook (obviously replace `<filename.ipynb>` completely with the notebook filename.
3. Run `git commit -m "Adding notes based on lecture"` (or whatever message is appropriate: `-m` means 'message').
4. Then run `git push` to push the changes to GitHub.

If any of those commands indicate that there are no changes being recorded/pushed then it might be that you’re not editing the file that you think you are (this happens to me!).

On the GitHub web site you may need to force reload the view of the repository: Shift + Reload button usually does it in most browsers. You may also need to wait 5 to 10 seconds for the changes to become ‘visible’ before reloading. It’s not quite instantaeous.
