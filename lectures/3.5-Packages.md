# Packing It Up.

^ Packages (also called modules or libraries) are bundles of useful, related functions and constants.

---
### Examples of Packages Include

|      |      |
| :--- | :--- |
| `os`  | Operating System stuff (paths, processes, etc.) |
| `csv`   | Reading and Writing CSV files. |
| `math`  | Maths constants and functions. |
| `statistics` | Simple statistical tests & measures. |
| `urllib` | URL Reading (e.g. web pages). |
| `numpy`  | Numerical Python (scientific computing). |
| `scipy`  | Scientific Python (more scientific computing) |
| `sklearn` | Machine learning, clustering, etc. |

## Importing a Package

If a package is installed, then it's as simple as:
```
import packagename
```

You normally do this at the start of a program so that it's easy to see what the program requires to run:
```
import os
import math

... <rest of your code> ...
```

### What Can a Package Do?

There are many ways to find this out: **read the documentation**, **search Google**, and **search StackOverflow**. There's even a web site [python.readthedocs.io](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

But we can also **ask the package**:
```
import math
dir(math)
['__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__', ..., 'log', 'log10', 'log1p', 'modf', 'pi', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'trunc']
help(math.log10)
print(math.pi) 
```

---
### So...

1. `dir(<package name>)` lists all 'things' that `<package>` contains. 
2. By convention, things that start with `__` are 'private' (you shouldn't change them) and things that start *and* end with `__` are metadata.
3. Everything else you can interrogate with `help(<package name>.<thing in package>)`.

With `help(math.log10)` you get an answer like this:
```
Help on built-in function log10 in module math:

log10(x, /)
    Return the base 10 logarithm of x.
```

With `help(math.pi)` you get an answer `Help on float object`...

^ This tells you that `pi` is a float, it doesn't tell you what Pi *is* (an irrational number). So here's another case where the computer gives you a technically correct but not always helpful answer. In the context of the `math` package, Pi is a float constant.

---
### *More* Laziness: Aliases

Programmers *hate* typing more than they have to. So if you use the `math` library a *lot* then you might object to constantly writing:
```
area = math.pi * r**2
ln = math.log(area)
...
```
So we can use an alias instead:
```
import math as m
area = m.pi * r**2
...
```
You will see this used a *lot* with more complex libraries like Pandas (`pd`), Geopandas (`gpd`), and PySAL (`ps`).

---
### Importing *Part* of a Package

Sometimes even *that* is too much typing... or sometimes we only really want *one or two things* from a much larger package. In *that* case we can select these specifically:
```
from math import pi, log10
print(pi)
help(log10)
```

### Approach 1
```
pi = 3.1415
print(pi)
> 3.1415

import math as m
print(m.pi)
> 3.141592653589793

print(pi)
> 3.1415
```

+++
### Approach 2
```
pi = 3.1415
print(pi)
> 3.1415

from math import pi
print(pi)
> 3.141592653589793

print(math.pi)
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
> NameError: name 'm' is not defined
```
