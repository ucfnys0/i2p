# The Command Line

---
## Why?

Obviously, the first question most new programmers want to ask about the Command Line is: **why?**

As in: 
1. Why are you torturing me with this arcane knowledge? 
2. Why do I need to do this when we have slick IDEs now?
---
## The Answer?

No matter how long you *try* to avoid it, eventually you'll find things that can *only* be solved (or can be much more *quickly* solved) using the Command Line. 

Things like:

- Interacting with `git` is actually _easier_ on the Command Line.
- Installing and/or running developer-oriented tools (e.g. `docker`, `GDAL`, `proj4/6`).
- Bulk operations, peeking and poking at (large) files, navigating the File System... 
- Command-chaining/scripting: automate things that would be hard/annoying to do manually... 

A lot of this ties back to **data** and **servers**.

^ True story: 25 years ago I used to process more than 40GB of compressed plain-text data every day from my Titanium PowerBook. But that's because it was all running on a server in New Jersey while I was in Manhattan. Everything was done using the Command Line and SSH (secure shell).

## Core Commands
---
## Interacting with Files

| Command | Does | Example |
| :------ | :--- | :------ |
| `ls` | List | `ls .` |
| `cd` | Change Directory | `cd ~` |
| `pwd` | Print Working Directory | `pwd` |
| `mv` | Move | `mv a.txt b.txt` |

You'll also notice some 'shortcuts' here:

| Shortcut | Means |
| :------- | :---- |
| `.` | The _current_ directory where commands will be executed. |
| `..` | The directory _above_ the current one (or 'containing', if you prefer). |
| `~` | The current user's _home_ directory |

^ Notice that most commands on the Command Line involve typing mnemonics (the shortest possible combination of letters that is unique memorable).

cd Dropbox
pwd
> /Users/casa/Dropbox
ls
> CASA  Lectures  Practicals ...
cd /
pwd
> /
ls
> Applications  Library  System  Users Volumes ...
```

## Finding Things in Files

| Command | Does | Example |
| :------ | :--- | :------ |
| `less` | Peek at contents of a text file | `less file.txt` |
| `grep` | Find lines 'matching' pattern in a text file | `grep 'pattern' file.txt` |
| `head` | Peek at first `x` rows of a text file | `head -n 10 file.txt` |
| `tail` | Peek at last `x` rows of a text file | `tail -n 10 file.txt` |
| `wc` | Count things (rows, words, etc. | `wc -l file.txt` |

---
### Time to Escape!

Some characters are 'special' and need to be **escaped**. You'll encounter these both in the shell (a.k.a. command line) and in Python:

| Escape | Does | Example |
| :----- | :--- | :------ |
| `\ `   | Allows spaces in file names | `less My\ File\ with\ Spaces.txt` |
| `\t`   | Creates/matches a tab character | `\tThe start of a paragraph...` |
| `\n`   | Creates/matches a newline character | `The end of a row/para...\n` |
| `\r`   | Creates/matches a carriange return | `The end of a row/para...\r\n` |
| `\$`   | Literal dollar sign (since `$` often marks a variable) | `It costs \$1,000,000` |
| `\!`   | Literal exclamation mark (since `!` can mean a number of things) | `Don't forget me\!` |

This also becomes relevant when you're dealing with quotes:
```
""This is a problem," she said."
```
vs. 
```
"\"This is a problem,\" she said."
```
^ The carriage return is only ever encountered on files that have been opened on Windows machines.

---
## Compressing/Decompressing Files
| Command | Does | Example |
| :------ | :--- | :------ |
| `gzip` | Compress/Decompress files | `gzip file.txt` |
| `gunzip` | Decompress files | `gunzip file.txt.gz`[ ^1 ] |

But we can make this more useful by chaining commands together using the 'pipe' (`|`):
```bash
gzip -cd very_lg_file.txt.gz | head -n 500 | grep "pattern"
```
This will give you an 'answer' much, much, much faster than trying to open the whole file in, say, Excel, Numbers, or even Python.

[ ^1 ]: This can also be done using 'switches' passed to gzip: `gzip -cd` (where `-d` means 'decompress'). 

---
## Redirecting Output

We can redirect outputs *in to* new files with `>`, and inputs *out of* existing files using `<`:
```bash
gzip -cd very_lg_file.txt.gz | head -n 500 | grep "pattern" > matches.txt
```

This directs all of the output from the previous commands into `matches.txt` as plain-text. The reverse `<` is only used in very special circumstances so you probably won't encounter it very often.

---
### A (Complex) Example

I do _not_ expect you to understand this, but I do want you to understand why this is important:
```bash
docker run -v conda:/home/jovyan/work --rm ${DOCKER_NM} start.sh \
   conda env export -n ${ENV_NM} | sed '1d;$d' | sed '$d' \
   | perl -p -e 's/^([^=]+=)([^=]+)=.+$/$1$2/m' \
   | grep -Ev '\- _|cpp|backports|\- lib|\- tk|\- xorg' > conda/environment_py.yml
```

^ This is how I generated the YAML file used by Anaconda Python installers: it is running a command on a virtual machine, collecting the output, filtering out lines by both row number and textual pattern, and directing this all in the `environment_py.yml` file. This can be run as part of my 'build' of the programming environment. It's **all** automated!
