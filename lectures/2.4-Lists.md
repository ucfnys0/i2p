## What's in a List?

In the same way that a paper shopping list holds many 'types' of shopping in one place, a Python list holds many 'types' of data in one place.

```python
myList = [1, 3, 5, 7]     # homogenous list
myList = [1, "dog", 7.01] # heterogenous list 
myList = []               # empty list
```

Python lists are *always* recognisable by their "square brackets": `[...]`
---
## What's in a List? (Part 2)

In fact, when I say lists can hold **many** types of data, I should have said that they can hold **any** type of data:

```python
x = 3
y = "Foo"
z = ["A", "list", 42]

a = [x, y, z]
```
The output of `a` is:
```python
[3, 'Foo', ['A', 'list', 42]]
```
^ We're going to come back to this a _lot_ later, but for now notice that a list can hold lists!

## Accessing Lists

^ Why is a Python list like a lift in Europe, and *not* like an elevator in America?

## Using List Indexes
Worked example:

```python
geographers = ["Massey", "Harvey", "Rose"]
```

Lists are 'indexed' _numerically_ from the **zero**-th element:

| Massey [ ^1 ] | Harvey [ ^2 ] | Rose [ ^3 ] |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 0      | 1      | 2      |

```python
>>> print(geographers[1])
Harvey
>>> print(geographers[2])
Rose
>>> print(geographers[3])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```
^ And notice this error: Python _tells_ you waht the problem is. The issue is understanding what the message _means_ if you don't know the vocabulary.
[ ^1 ]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doreen_Massey_(geographer)
[ ^2 ]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey
[ ^3 ]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Rose_(geographer)

### Interpolation 

We can also use **variables** as list indexes:

| Massey | Harvey | Rose |
| ------ | ------ | ---- |
| 0      | 1      | 2    |

```python
>>> i = 0
>>> print(geographers[i])
Massey
```

**Anything** that evaluates (i.e. resolves) to a number can be used as an index:

```python
>>> i = 1
>>> print(geographers[i+1])
Rose
>>> print(geographers[ (i-2+1)*2 ])
Massey
```

---

### Countdown!

We can 'count' backwards from the *end* of the list using *negative* numbers:

```python
>>> print( geographers[-1] )
Rose
>>> print( geographers[-2] )
Harvey
```

---

### Does Not Compute!

Errors can be scary... but informative

```python
>>> print( geographers[5] )
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range

>>> print( geographers[1.25] )
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not float
```

Although there is quite a lot of output for such a simple mistake, notice that Python is giving us important hints about the source of the problem:

> IndexError: **list index out of range**
>
> TypeError: **list indices must be integers or slices, not float**

---

### Slicing Lists

You can access more than one element at a time using a *slice*:

```python
>>> print( geographers[0:2] )
['Massey','Harvey']
>>> print( geographers[1:2] )
['Harvey']
>>> print( geographers[1:] )
['Harvey', 'Rose']
>>> print( geographers[-2:] )
['Harvey', 'Rose']
```

The syntax for a slice is: `list[ <start_idx>, <end_idx> ]` What can be confusing is that the end index (`end_idx`) is *not* included in the slice. This is why `[1:2]` only returns a slice with one element.

^ It's really subtle, but notice that a slice *always* returns a list, even if it's just a list containing one thing. So `geographers[1]=='Harvey'` but `geographers[1:2]==['Harvey']`. **Not** the same thing!

---

### Test Yourself

What do you think this will produce?

```python
>>> i = 2
>>> print( geographers[ (i-3)**2-4:-1 ] )
```

See if you can work out in your head before typing it!

## Finding Things in Lists
---
### Where _is_ It?

`list.index(...)` tells you **where** something can be found in a list:

```python
>>> geographers.index("Harvey")
1
>>> geographers.index("Massey")
0
```

Combining ideas that will become very useful later:

```python
>>> print(geographers[ geographers.index("Massey") ])
```

What do you think this prints? Why does it work at *all*?

^ This last example looks a little strange, but what if I had a separate list with *first* names, or Wikipedia links, or other information about these geographers? Because `list.index(x)` returns an integer we can use it *as* an index for accessing *another* list.

---
### Is it There at All?
`list.index(...)` has one flaw:
```python
>>> geographers.index('Batty')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: 'Batty' is not in list
```
There are ways to handle this, but often 'throwing an error' is overkill; here's another way:
```python
if 'Batty' in geographers:
    print("Found Mike!")
else:
    print("Not a geographer!")

```

---

### Sorting

We can sort lists in alpha-numerical order:

```python 
>>> geographers.sort()
>>> print(geographers)
['Harvey', 'Massey', 'Rose']
```

And we can reverse-sort them too:

```python
>>> geographers.sort(reverse=True)
>>> print(geographers)
['Rose', 'Massey', 'Harvey']
```

## Changing Lists
---
### Lists are Mutable 

Mutable == "liable or subject to change or alteration"

```python
>>> geographers = ["Massey","Harvey","Rose"]
>>> geographers[2] = "Jefferson"
>>> print(geographers)
['Massey','Harvey','Jefferson']
```

---

### Adding/Removing Items in Lists

When we `insert()` items into, or `pop()` items out of, a list we normally need to specify the index. 

```python
>>> geographers.insert(0,"von Humboldt")
>>> print(geographers)
['von Humboldt', 'Massey', 'Harvey', 'Jefferson']
>>> geographers.insert(3,"von Humboldt")
>>> print(geographers)
['von Humboldt', 'Massey', 'Harvey', 'von Humboldt', 'Jefferson']
```

And in 'reverse':

```python
>>> geographers.pop(3)
'von Humboldt'
>>> print(geographers)
['von Humboldt', 'Massey', 'Harvey', 'Jefferson']
```

---

### Test Yourself

There are **two ways** to remove David Harvey from the list of geographers _without_ writing this:

```python
>>> geographers.pop(2) # This is not the answer!
```

1. You can *adapt* an [example we saw earlier](#finding-things-in-lists) in 'Finding Things'.
2. You can [use Google](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+remove+an+item+from+a+list+in+python). 
^ _Hints:_ `remove` and `del` are both options here.

## Combining Lists

---

### Concatenation

We can combine lists using addition:

```python
>>> female_geographers = ['Rose','Valentine','Massey','Jefferson']
>>> male_geographers = ['Von Humboldt','Harvey','Hägerstrand']
>>> all_geographers = female_geographers + male_geographers
>>> print(all_geographers)
['Rose', 'Valentine', 'Massey', 'Jefferson', 'Von Humboldt', 'Harvey', 'Hägerstrand']
>>> print(all_geographers[0])
Rose
```

---

### Appending

Appending does something a **bit different**:

```python 
>>> female_geographers = ['Rose','Valentine','Massey','Jefferson']
>>> male_geographers = ['Von Humboldt','Harvey','Hägerstrand']
>>> all_geographers = []
>>> all_geographers.append(female_geographers)
>>> all_geographers.append(male_geographers)
>>> print(all_geographers)
[['Rose', 'Valentine', 'Massey', 'Jefferson'], ['Von Humboldt', 'Harvey', 'Hägerstrand']]
>>> print(all_geographers[0])
['Rose', 'Valentine', 'Massey', 'Jefferson']
```

What do you think has happened here?

---

### Test Yourself

```python
>>> male_geographers = ['Von Humboldt','Harvey','Hägerstrand']
>>> male_geographers.append('Batty')
```

What do you think `print(male_geographers)` will produce? And why do you think that `append` **appears** to do something different in these two examples?

## Finally...

---

### How many geographers do I know?

`len(...)` gives you the **len**gth of 'countable' things:

```python
>>> geographers = ["Massey","Harvey","Rose"]
>>> len(geographers)
3
```

But...

```python
>>> female_geographers = ['Rose','Valentine','Massey','Jefferson']
>>> male_geographers = ['Von Humboldt','Harvey','Hägerstrand']
>>> all_geographers = []
>>> all_geographers.append(female_geographers)
>>> all_geographers.append(male_geographers)
>>> print( len(all_geographers) )
2
```

---

### Remember: Who's in the List?

```python
>>> geographers = ["Massey","Harvey","Rose"]
>>> print("Massey" in geographers)
True
>>> print("Batty" in geographers)
False
```

But... 

```python
>>> geographers = ["Massey","Harvey","Rose"]
>>> geographers.index('Massey')
0
>>> geographers.index('Batty')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: 'Batty' is not in list
```

Thinking *logically* why might you choose one of these over the other? 

---
### Test Yourself

How would you change this code:
```python
>>> geographers = ["Massey","Harvey","Rose"]
>>> print("Massey" in geographers)
True
>>> print("Batty" in geographers)
False
```

So that it prints:
```python
False
True
```

You will have seen the answer to this in Code Camp, but you can also [Google the it](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=find+out+if+an+item+is+not+in+a+list+python)!

## A Special Kind of 'List'

Because they come up a _lot_ in geo-data analysis, it's worth knowing about **tuples**. The easiest way to think about tuples is as an **immutable** list.

```python
>>> t = (52.124021, -0.0012012)
>>> type(t)
<class 'tuple'>
>>> t
(52.124021, -0.0012012)
>>> t[0]
52.124021
>>> t[0] = 25.1203210
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```
