## Question!

What the heck is *this*?
```
my_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```
How about if we rewrote it like *this*?
```
my_list = [
  [1, 2, 3], 
  [4, 5, 6], 
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```

![Quick Quiz](mi_question_answer)  What does this *look* like?

---
### Making Sense of This

We can 'unpack' `my_list` in stages in order to make sense of it:

```
my_list = [
  [1, 2, 3], 
  [4, 5, 6], 
  [7, 8, 9]
]

for i in my_list:
  print(i)
```

What do you **think** this will print?
---
### Debugging Our Thinking

Let's make it a little more obvious:
```
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
c = [7, 8, 9]
my_list = [
  a, 
  b, 
  c]
for i in my_list:
  print(i)
```

---
### The Next Step
We could then try this:
```
for i in my_list:
  print(f" >> {i}")
  for j in i: # Remember that i is a list!
    print(j)
```
This produces:
```
 >> [1, 2, 3]
1
2
3
 >> [4, 5, 6]
4
...
```
---
### Putting It Together

```
my_list = [
  [1, 2, 3], 
  [4, 5, 6], 
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```
We can access each list (`i`) by iterating over `my_list`. And we can access each element (`j`) of `i` using `i[j]`. 

**Can we... `my_list[i][j]`?**
---
### Let's Try It!
```
print(my_list[0][0])
> 1
print(my_list[2][2])
> 9
```
So `my_list[0]` grabs the first list (`[1,2,3]`) and then `my_list[0][0]` tells Python to get the first item in that first list (i.e. `1`).

Similarly, `my_list[2]` grabs the third list (`[7,8,9]`) and then `my_list[2][2]` tells Python to get the third item in that third list (i.e. `9`).

## Making This Useful

If I rewrite my list *this way* perhaps it looks a little more useful?
```
my_cities = [
  ['London', 51.5072, 0.1275, +0], 
  ['New York', 40.7127, 74.0059, -5], 
  ['Tokyo', 35.6833, 139.6833, +8]
]
```
Now we have something that is starting to look like **data**!

### LOLs of LOLs

This is *also* a legitimate list in Python. 
```
my_cities = [
  ['London', [51.5072, 0.1275], +0], 
  ['New York', [40.7127, 74.0059], -5], 
  ['Tokyo', [35.6833, 139.6833], +8]
]
print(my_cities[0][0])
> London
print(my_cities[0][1][0])
> 51.5072
```
![Quick Quiz](mi_question_answer)  Why might it be a *better* choice of **data structure** than the earlier version?

## How Deep Can You Go?

> There is no real limit to how many lists you can nest inside of other lists. The only problem is accessing them!

It's **hard** to make sense of: `my_cities[0][1][4][1][8]`!
^ That's why most sane people rarely use more then three levels of lists. You will see developers iterate over them using `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Have fun!
```
my_dict = {
  'London': [[51.5072, 0.1275], +0], 
  'New York': [[40.7127, 74.0059], -5], 
  'Tokyo': [[35.6833, 139.6833], +8]
}
